# pi_project

Steps to reproduce:

1. Set up Raspberry Pi with headless Raspian
2. SSH into RPi
3. Download libraries to RPi:

* ```sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y```
* ```sudo apt install python3```
* ```sudo apt install python3-pip```
* ```sudo apt install git vim -y```
* ```pip3 install RPi.GPIO```
* ```pip3 install requests```
* ```pip3 install json```
* ```pip3 install base64```

4. Clone git repository to RPi:

    ```git clone https://github.com/joshwh11/pi_project```

5. Set up breadboard with Raspberry Pi. Requires:
* Breadboard
* 3x Female-to-Male wires
* 2x LED Pins (1 red, 1 yellow)
* 2x 220Î© Resistors 

    (Super rough diagrams for reference are in the "schematic" folder)

6. Test out pins by running the ledtest.py file after changing directory to the pi_project folder:

    ```cd pi_project```
    
    ```python3 ledtest.py```
    
7. Now that the lights are working, let's set up a GitHub repository to hold the file that AppDynamics will update if a policy is triggered. Create an account if
   you do not already have one and create a repo with one file named "syntheticHealth.txt" that contains simply a 0. 0 will be the default "off" state of the LED. 
   If a policy is triggered, AppDynamics will update the file to a 1, or "on" state. Also, you will need a token to authenticate any request to update a GitHub 
   file. To generate a token, click on the icon drop-down at the top right of GitHub page after logging in -> Click "Settings" -> Click "Developer settings" -> 
   Click "Personal access tokens" -> Click "Generate new token"

8. Time to set up an AppDynamics HTTP request action. From the controller, navigate to the Alert & Respond tab, then to HTTP Request Templates, then create a new
   template. 
   
   * Method: PUT
   * Raw URL: https://<span></span>api.github.com/repos/\<your username\>/\<your repo\>/contents/syntheticHealth.txt
   * Custom Request Header: 
       * Authorization: token \<your token\>
   * Payload:
       * MIME Type: application/json
       * Content: 
       
```
{
  "message": "update syntheticHealth.txt from AppD",
  "committer": {
    "name": "<your name>",
    "email": "<your email>"
  },
  "content": "MQ==",
  "sha": "<syntheticHealth.txt SHA>"
}
```

    Note: The committer values will be your information linked to your GitHub account. The content value is the number 1 in Base64 code. The sha value should be the
    unique SHA identifier given to your syntheticHealth.txt file. This changes sometimes, but you can run the getSHA.py script provided in this repo to find it.
    
    Save and test this HTTP Request Template.
    
9. To update the LED pins, the RPi will be continuously running the checkHealth.py application as AppDynamics updates the syntheticHealth.txt file via policy 
   triggers. On your RPi, navigate to pi_project and run checkHealth.py via:
   
   ```python3 checkHealth.py```
   
   Now the RPi will constantly check the contents of your syntheticHealth.txt file hosted on your GitHub repo and will update the LED pin state given the content
   of the file.
